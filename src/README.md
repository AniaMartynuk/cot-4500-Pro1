1. **Approximation Algorithm**
2. **Bisection Method**
3. **Fixed-Point Iteration**
4. **Newton-Raphson Method**


- **Approximation Algorithm** - Used to get an approximation of a root.
- **Bisection Method** - This method looks for a root between two values where the function changes signs.
- **Fixed-Point Iteration** - Solves equations of the form `x = g(x)`.
- **Newton-Raphson Method** - A faster method that uses derivatives to find better approximations.
